{:.note}
* **Developers, that just want to develop** and do not want to fiddle with ops
  stuff
  > * Enjoy the beauty of a *just working* development environment, that behaves
  >   the same throughout our whole team.
  > * Be happy you no longer need to care about installing and configuring
  >   server software on your local system, leave that to your colleagues that
  >   enjoy this kind of work.
  > * Switch between any project whenever you want: They already ship with the
  >   proper development environment, no need to reconfigure your local system.
  > * Relish how great it can be if your local development environment behaves
  >   just like that otherwise so often blackboxed test/stage/production
  >   environments you do want to have something to do with.
* **Developers, that like the underlying ops work** and love doing best on it
  > * Setup your project once and just enjoy it how your colleagues are no
  >   have problems and are just as efficient as you.
  > * Have control over how things are put together on your development
  >   environment, continuously being able to improve and change it, knowing
  >   is not only you, but all your team mates that benefit.
  > * Break out of the ops-blackbox: With you app being dokerized, it can be
  >   all the same throughout any environment, whether it on your local system,
  >   a test and stage environments and even production.
* **Ops**, that so often just is annoyed by *that devs*
  > * Get stunned by your dev-colleagues: They designed and wrote the app and
  >   had to come up with a working setup, otherwise they wouldn't be able to
  >   develop it. With their app being dockerized and the development
  >   environment shipping with the app, you now see how it is working.
  > * Instead of re-adjusting their app to work in your unbreakable
  >   infrastructure kingdom, help them with their development environment, so
  >   it becomes as great as the infrastructure you are already proud of.
