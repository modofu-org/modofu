# modofu uses Jekyll for the documentation

> If you search for modofu documentation, it is this folder, but you might have
> a hard time reading it from here, since it first needs to be rendered by
> Jekyll to actually become useful. If you want to work on the documentation,
> please have a look [further down](#working-on-the-documentation).
