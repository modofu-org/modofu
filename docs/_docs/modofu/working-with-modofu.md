> - `modofu help`

* Since modofu is intended to be used on project level, you first should
  change directory to a local checkout of your project's code:
  - `cd ~/path/to/your/projects/code` *Usually this is a git repository*

* Afterwards you can run commands like:
  - `modofu dev start` *to start your local development setup*
  - `modofu dev stop` *to stop your local development setup*
  - `modofu dev remove` *to get rid of your local development setup*
  - `modofu dev help` *to get a list of supported other `dev` arguments*
